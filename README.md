## Hi, I’m Patsy 👋         

I’m a Frontend-focused Full-Stack Developer who loves building digital experiences that are not only functional, but meaningful.

I thrive at the intersection of logic and creativity. I enjoy transforming complex business requirements into elegant, intuitive user experiences. Whether it's implementing microfrontends, improving performance, or designing clean component abstractions, I focus on building products that truly serve people.

Currently, I’m expanding my knowledge in cloud architecture, AI-driven solutions, and scalable frontend systems — always looking for ways to create smarter and more impactful digital products.

✨ I believe great software is built with clarity, intention, and empathy for the end user.
